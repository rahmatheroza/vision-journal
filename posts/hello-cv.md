## 👁️ 2. What is Computer Vision?

**Computer Vision (CV)** is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world—images, videos, and real-time camera input.

Similar to how humans use their eyes and brain to process what they see, CV gives machines the ability to:
- Detect objects
- Recognize faces
- Classify images
- Understand scenes

It bridges the gap between digital pixels and meaningful understanding.
